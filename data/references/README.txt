Put verified genuine banknote photographs here (JPG or PNG).

Required format:
- One complete note per image.
- Flat, upright and well lit; crop out unrelated background when possible.
- The complete note should be visible and suitable for quadrilateral detection.
- Use the same denomination, design, series, and orientation as the scans you expect to compare.
- Filename may be descriptive, for example 500_verified_front_01.jpg.
- Verified front and reverse references should be stored separately.

The existing engine aligns each whole-note reference, then crops and compares the same
seven canonical regions used by SmartRupee: top-left, top-right, bottom-left,
bottom-right, security thread, central-left and central-right.

Images in this folder are used for visual reference matching; adding them does not
retrain the shared neural anomaly model. Multiple photos of one physical note can
improve matching across views, but are not independent training examples and do not
teach the system to identify counterfeit notes.

Do not use this folder for unverified, synthetic, altered, scraped or invented
"genuine" images. Images here are not physical authenticity evidence and RGB photos
cannot verify tactile, UV or infrared features.
